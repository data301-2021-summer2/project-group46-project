## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

We hope to gain further insight into the world of Kickstarter. As two avid boargame fans, we frequently interact with the products of this site. By studying it we hope to understand what leads to a succesful Kickstarter product, i.e. what factors lead into campaigns being succesful and the best projects to back. Rylan is particularly interested in which categories of products (Music, games, boardgames, art, etc) have the best dollar to success ratio. Jacob is interested in how the funding time zone for a project effects its success, for example do shorter projects result in more succesful products or do longer ones? There is so much more than this that we can look into, connections between funding goals and project duration, or funding goals and project category. A dashboard could be interesting with visual guides for different categories and pricings and how much success they bring.

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

The dataset contains data on roughly 376,000 crowdfunded projects from the Kickstarter Platform: (https://www.kickstarter.com/). The data was collected from the Kickstarter Platform (https://www.kickstarter.com/). We retrieved the data from the following source: https://www.kaggle.com/kemical/kickstarter-projects. The data contains several factors related to individual Kickstarter projects. Some of these factors are the name of the project, the category, the start and end data of the funding time zone, the fundraising goal, the country, the number of backers, the state of the project, and several other factors.The data set we used was from 2018. The dataset could be used to explore several different topics related to Kickstarter projects which may help those who are interested in starting a Kickstarter project of their own. For example, the dataset could be used to see what categories have the most projects or what factors are related to a projectâ€™s success. The data was collected by an individual, here are more details: https://www.kaggle.com/kemical/kickstarter-projects.
